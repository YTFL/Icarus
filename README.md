Icarus is an AI-powered repository context engine designed to bridge the gap between human conversation and complex codebases. By leveraging advanced vector search and real-time voice synthesis, Icarus allows developers to "talk" to their code. It automatically indexes public GitHub repositories, analyzes the project structure, and provides a semantic understanding of the source code to a voice-enabled AI assistant.

## The Icarus Experience

Interacting with Icarus is simple and intuitive:

1.  **Repository Indexing**: Users provide a URL to any public GitHub repository. 
2.  **Analysis**: Icarus works in the background to download the source, map the folder architecture, and chunk the code into searchable context.
3.  **Voice Interaction**: Once indexed, a floating voice widget becomes active. Users can click the button and start speaking naturally to Icarus.
4.  **Context-Aware Dialog**: You can ask questions like:
    *   *"Can you explain the main logic in the backend?"*
    *   *"Where is the database connection handled?"*
    *   *"Give me a high-level overview of the project structure."*
5.  **Real-Time Retrieval**: Icarus retrieves the most relevant snippets from the repository in milliseconds, giving the voice assistant the "memory" it needs to provide accurate technical answers.

## Technical Details

Icarus is built using a modern AI-native stack:

### Frontend
- **Vanilla HTML5/CSS3**: A premium, dark-themed interface with high attention to aesthetics and typography.
- **Vapi Client SDK**: Integrated via the Vapi widget for high-performance, low-latency voice AI interaction.
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Feedback loops for repo cloning and indexing progress.

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: A high-performance Python web framework for handling ingestion and context retrieval.
- **Qdrant Cloud**: A managed vector database used to store and query code embeddings with high efficiency.
- **Sentence Transformers**: Specifically the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, used to generate 384-dimensional embeddings for code chunks.
- **Repo Ingestion Engine**: A custom pipeline that clones public repos, filters non-essential files (like `node_modules` or `.git`), and processes allowed extensions (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, etc.).
- **Master Architecture Mapping**: A specialized indexing step that captures the entire project tree for structural queries.

### Requirements & Setup
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Qdrant Cloud Account** (URL and API Key)
- **Vapi AI Account** (Public Key and Assistant ID)
- **FastAPI Dependencies**: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `qdrant-client`, `sentence-transformers`, `requests`.
